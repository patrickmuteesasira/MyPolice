              <h4>About Police</h4>
              <p>Crimes were defined by the respective tribal community according to their agreed cultural norms and values. Punitive measures for cases of indiscipline would be determined by a council of elders. When Uganda became a British protectorate in 1894, a judicial system based on the British common law was imposed with the backing of an armed police force.
                Hence, the Uganda Police Force was first established as Uganda armed constabulary in 1899 with the main aim of maintaining public order. The recruitment procedures, organisation and training were based on the Royal Irish Constabulary mode of armed policing.

            <h5>Brief History</h5>

            <p>In the early 1980s, there was recruitment of university graduates into the force. Most of these were trained in Munduli, Tanzania. There was also a “screening of dead wood”, dictated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
                President Milton Obote’s second administration also started the National Security Agency (NASA), which took on the role of criminal investigation and in the process, sidelined the regular police.
                During President Yoweri Museveni’s NRA bush war, many police stations were attacked and many officers killed.  In 1986 when NRM took power, there was another screening that reduced the number of police officers from about 10,000 to 3,000.
            </p>

            <p> The Special Forces, which had been loyal to Obote’s UPC government, was disbanded and replaced by the Mobile Police Patrol Unit. There was also more recruitment of university graduates as constables, which saw about 300 graduates join the force, reducing the number of semi-illiterate officers.

              <br>Thus, the mode of recruitment ceased to be about just physical fitness, but included consideration of intellectual abilities.
